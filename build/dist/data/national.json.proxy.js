Also, ad fees are often decided by the number of clicks an ad gets (i.e. the more clicks an ad gets, the higher the ad fee becomes), which incentivizes social media sites to target ads to specific individuals based on information the site has collected (e.g. cookies, history of smartphone use etc).\n",[414,415,416,417]],"55":["2019 East\n\tR1\n\t\tTHW censor and remove all contents (including books and tweets) which are deemed to be anti-vaccination.\n\tR2\n\t\tTH, as ASEAN member states, would pursue relationship with China as opposed to the US.\n\tR3\n\t\tTHBT oppressed minorities should emphasize individualism over collectivism to their children.\n\t\t\tINDIVIDUALISM and COLLECTISM describe the attitude of individuals to their communities.In individualism, people prefer to act as individuals rather than members of groups.
